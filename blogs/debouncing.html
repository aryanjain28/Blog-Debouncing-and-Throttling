      <div id="mainHeading">Debouncing & Throttling in React</div>

      <div id="mainBody">What is it exactly? Where and why is it used?</div>

      <div id="majorHeading">The "What"</div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        In essence, when we require a function to execute following a specified
        delay period, we refer to this as "debouncing." To illustrate, consider
        a scenario where a user is typing, and once they pause, we intend to
        initiate a fetch API request. This concept is known as debouncing. You
        may have encountered this behavior while utilizing search forms for
        worldwide university searches.

        <br />
        <br />

        Furthermore, think of a situation where a user continues typing
        incessantly without pausing. In such instances, we may need to trigger
        fetch API requests at defined intervals, regardless of whether the user
        halts or persists. This concept is termed "throttling."

        <br />
        <br />

        Alright, let's simplify this. Debouncing and throttling are kind of
        similar. For the rest of this blog, when I talk about debouncing, it
        also applies to throttling. So, I'll just focus on explaining
        debouncing.
      </div>

      <div id="contentImages">
        <center>
          <img src="img1.png" width="400" height="" />
        </center>
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        Debouncing might appear simple at first glance. We basically encase our
        function within a "setTimeout." But hold on a moment – when has React
        ever been a walk in the park? Yet, once you grasp the concept, it
        becomes quite straightforward.

        <br />
        <br />

        Now, let's tackle the question at hand. If we put our function inside a
        "setTimeout," it will run after a set amount of time, and the timer
        won't restart. Take a look at the example below.
      </div>
      <br /><br />

      <div id="contentImages">
        <center>
          <img src="code_img1.png" width="500" height="" />
        </center>
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        This situation is quite straightforward to comprehend – the reason it's
        not functioning as expected is that it's simply following its
        instructions. It's been instructed to update the data value after
        waiting for 1 second (1000 milliseconds). However, this isn't the
        debouncing behavior we're aiming for. We somehow need to reset the timer
        back to 1 second each time the user stops typing.

        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        You can find a tons of resources on the internet explaining how
        debouncing works with React. I recently encountered a hurdle while
        incorporating this technique into one of my projects. I hit a point
        where I felt stuck and didn't know how to proceed. After some searching
        around, I stumbled upon a helpful solution.
        <br /><br />

        In my project, I had a specific goal: I wanted to save whatever text the
        user had typed, but only when they paused in their typing. During my
        online research, I consistently came across a particular piece of code
        used for debouncing:
        <br /><br />
      </div>

      <div id="contentImages">
        <center>
          <img src="code_img2.png" width="700" height="" />
        </center>
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">This is how it will wrap our code:</div>

      <div id="contentImages">
        <center>
          <img src="code_img3.png" width="700" height="" />
        </center>
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        Seems quite robust, doesn't it? But here's the catch – it doesn't
        actually function as intended. Debouncing appears to be on track, as the
        'timerId' is being reset as expected. However, there's an issue: the
        data is getting updated with a delay, which is not what we want.

        <br /><br />

        Now, let's dive into what's happening here. Why is it failing to work?
        The solution is rather straightforward – our data is being updated
        within the 'handleOnChange' function, which is nested inside the
        debounce function. It's quite evident that the data update itself is
        being debounced!

        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />

        The fix appears to be straightforward: we just need to figure out a way
        to remove the setData function from within the debounce wrapper!

        <br /><br />

        Inside the debounce wrapper, we should only keep the specific
        functionality that we want to debounce. Let's do it:
      </div>

      <div id="contentImages">
        <center>
          <img src="code_img4.png" width="700" height="" />
        </center>
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        At this point, everything appears to be in order, and there's a strong
        expectation that this solution will indeed be effective. After all, this
        is the precise solution that's commonly found online. The internet is
        typically reliable in such matters. <br /><br />
        However, after giving it a try, it turns out that it doesn't function as
        expected.
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        Umm. But why? Everything looked fine to me.
        <br /><br />
        <i>My thought process:</i>
        <br /><br />
        Ok. Take a deep breath.
        <br /><br />
        Now. What's happening?
        <br /><i
          >=> So, the data is updating fine, but the debounce function is not.
        </i>
        <br /><br />

        And, what's wrong with the debounced function?<br />
        <i
          >=> It runs each time with a delay, it doesn't override the previous
          run, which it is supposed to do.</i
        >
        <br /><br />

        Hmm. So it seems like its not resetting, more specifically, its not
        resetting the timerId.
        <br /><i
          >=> Indeed, after staring at screen for a few hours, I found the
          same.TIMER_ID was always undefined, it is supposed to update with the
          latest one.</i
        >

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img2.png" width="300" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="mainBody">
          Upon closer examination, I discovered the culprit: it's all about
          RE-RENDERING! Once I realized this, I couldn't help but wonder how I
          overlooked such a crucial detail. Here's the deal: the moment we
          trigger the onChange event and set the data to the new value, the
          component undergoes a re-render, causing the timerId to vanish.
          Without the timerId, there's no resetting, and consequently, no
          debouncing.
          <br /><br />
          However, I wasn't ready to give up just yet. I believed there had to
          be a solution – after all, how challenging could it be? So, I delved
          into my search once more. To my surprise, everything I came across
          pointed towards the prebuilt "debounce" function in the lodash
          library. Undoubtedly, it simplifies matters, but I wanted to create my
          own custom debouncing wrapper function.
        </div>

        <div id="mainBody">
          So, I had a realization: the issue isn't really about re-rendering;
          it's more about creating a new debounce function every time a
          re-render occurs. After gazing at my screen for an additional 2 hours,
          it hit me.
          <br /><br />
          I can create a reference of my debounce function using useRef. This
          should surely give me the previous function. Let’s try this code:
        </div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="code_img5.png" width="600" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="mainBody">Complete code:</div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="code_img6.png" width="600" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="mainBody">
          Look at it, it looks so sweet!🥺
          <br /><br />
          I was so confident with this one! I knew it was the one!

          <br /><br />

          And as it turned out, I celebrated too soon it didn't work!
        </div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img3.png" width="600" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="mainBody">
          What is wrong now?
          <br /><br />
          It seems like my input data is not changing. And it is stuck at the
          initial point.
          <br />But why ? <br /><br />
          Ok. After looking at the screen for another hour, I came to a
          realization. Our debounce function is invoked just once – during the
          mounting of our component and the initialization of the ref. To put it
          differently, if I were to log data within my debounce function, it
          would remain fixed at the initial value and appear as if it's not
          changing.
          <br /><br />
          But here's the interesting part. I can write a useEffect with "data"
          as a dependency. This would allow me to update my ref to the latest
          version of 'functionWeWantToDebounce'. Let's quickly try this:
        </div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="code_img7.png" width="600" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="code_img8.png" width="600" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="mainBody">
          But now my debouncing doesn't work. Of course it won't, I am resetting
          the function on every data change
          <br /><br />
          So we're back to square one!
        </div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img4.png" width="400" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <br />
        .
        <br />
        .
        <br />
        .
        <br />
        .
        <br />
        <br />

        <div id="mainBody">
          Now what?
          <br /><br />
          After staring at my screen for another 4 hours (<i>and crying a bit</i
          >) I found a hint

          <br /><br />
          warning: burst of thoughts ahead
          <br />

          <br />
          We know that, in JavaScript, objects are mutable (can change). And
          only primitive values, like numbers or references to objects, will be
          “frozen” when a closure is created. If in our “frozen”
          (immutable) sendRequest function I will try to access ref.current,
          which is by definition mutable, I will get the latest version of it
          all the time! I have a gut feeling that this will work!
          <br /><br />Let's write code first, and then I'll explain:
          <br />
        </div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="code_img9.png" width="500" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="code_img10.png" width="700" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <div id="mainBody">And voila! It works!</div>
      </div>


        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img6.git" width="500" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>



      <div id="mainBody">
        <br /><br />
        So what's happening here? How did it work?
        <br />
        <br />
        1. I made a function called "functionWeWantToDebounce" that triggers a
        re-render every time it's used. To manage this function, I also set up a
        reference (let's call it "ref").
        <br /><br />
        2. Then, I established another function called "debouncedCallback." This
        debounced function is only created a single time, specifically during
        the component's initial mounting.
        <br /><br />
        3. Lastly, I provided a separate function (to the debounced function)
        that can access the most current value in the "ref." This "ref" actually
        holds the latest version of "functionWeWantToDebounce." This way,
        everything works smoothly together.
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <div id="mainBody">
        Now, the only remaining task is to craft a simple yet effective hook.
        This hook will package everything mentioned earlier and will be
        conveniently accessible to envelop our functions wherever needed. Let's
        go ahead and get that done!

          <img src="code_img11.png" width="700" height="" />
